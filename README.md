# AI/ML Learning Roadmap – Backend & System Programming Focus

This repository documents my complete, structured journey into **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, designed specifically from the perspective of a **backend developer** and **system programmer**.

The repo includes:

- A phase-based learning plan  
- Notes for each topic  
- Hands-on exercises  
- Python implementations  
- Real-world ML mini-projects  
- Backend + system-level insights for serving, optimizing, and integrating ML models  

The goal is not only to learn ML, but to understand how ML works at a low level, how data flows through systems, and how AI components interact inside backend architectures.

## 🔥 Why This Repository Exists

- To build strong foundations in ML using clean, verifiable code  
- To track progress through a multi-phase structured roadmap  
- To learn ML concepts relevant to backend development and system programming  
- To create production-ready mini utilities and implementations  
- To have a public portfolio of AI/ML learning projects
